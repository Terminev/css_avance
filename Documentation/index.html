                    downloaded. Inside this
                    file you will find several elements. The first one is the Template folder, this is where you will
                    find all the elements that make up the CSS theme and the second file "Documentation", this is the
                    page you are currently reading, this folder will be useful to install and understand how the theme
                    works</p>
